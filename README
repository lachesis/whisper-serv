Simple python server for whisper.cpp

Probably not secure, put it behind basic auth

Post an AV file with any name to:

    http://localhost:8080/transcribe

Optional query arg:
?f=stream -> stream stdout/stderr from whisper.cpp, with output files at end
?f=srt -> just an SRT, at end of run
?f=txt -> just a TXT, at end of run
